            Here's my Weather-Journal App Project :)


I've folowed the steps mentioned in developement strategy in the classroom .. 
1) I've installed node.js and then I've installed express,body-parser, and cors from the terminal by the command (npm install .....) and i've set up package.json to show it ..
-I've chosen port 8000 to run the server on , and made an arrow callback function to show a message on the terminal that the server is running ..

2)I've added a GET route that returns the projectData object in the server code Then, added a POST route that adds incoming data to projectData.

3)I've used my credentials and the base url and API key i've received from OpenWeatherMap.org to connect to it.

4)I've chained another Promise that makes a POST request to add the API data, as well as data entered by the user, to my app.

5)I've chained another Promise that updates the UI dynamically.

6)The last step I did is changing some style in the css file :)
